What type of video game comes to mind if you were asked, "what genre of video game sells the most copies?". My mind goes straight to shooters like Call of Duty or Halo. Growing up in the early 2000s, those were the games that most of the people I knew were playing. To find out the real answer, I grabbed a dataset from Kaggle with a list of 16598 video games that sold over 100,000 copies. Also, all these games are from 1980 to 2020. With that dataset, I created this graph below.

Looking at the graph above, the black bar is global sales for each genre, and the rest of the bars is broken down by North America, Europe, Japan,  and all other places. As you can see,  North America, I imagine mostly the US, really love their video games. They top the charts in almost every genre, except platform games where Japan sells take the lead.  But when it comes to genres like action, shooter, role-playing, simulation, and strategy North America is almost or over half of all global sales. But back to our main topic, from the looks of this graph, action video games are the top video game genres of all time. But has it always been that way? In this next graph, I'll break down the top genres over the past years.

Now we should take note this data is not the most up to date. There seems to be a crash in sales around the years 2007 - 2020. But the video game industry hasn't been on a decline since the mid-90s. Also, This data does not include mobile games. And the first iPhone came out in 2007, so that may also explain some of the dive. Looking at this graph we can see the action genre has not always been at the top. Let's take a look at this graph with only the genres that been at the top.

As you can see, fighting, shooter, sports, platform, puzzle, and role-playing have been at the top at one point or another. You can almost pinpoint when popular games came out based on spikes in a genre. Like you can see role-playing spiked in 1996, only less than two years after World of Warcraft came out. Then theirs that spike in puzzle games in 1989. And what was the most popular puzzle game in 1989? Tetris was after it's release to the US in 1988. And that spike in platform genre in 1985? That was Super Mario Bros.

In conclusion, action games reign supreme. And they don't seem to be going anytime soon.  Although as virtual reality games get better and more accessible,  I could see them taking the top of the charts. Maybe even become more massive than all other genres combined.
